## Serializable TST (Ternary Search Tree) ##

This implementation of Ternary Search Tree (TST) is designed for basic string storage and retrieval.
What sets it apart is its ability to serialize the tree into a text format, enabling easy reloading into memory at a later time.

This implementation is particularly useful for constructing a lookup table and supports the storage of values associated with strings.

Two example programs, 'store_val' and 'read_val', are provided. These programs allow you to store either strings alone or string-value pairs.

While I plan to add documentation soon, the example code is straightforward and easy to understand.
